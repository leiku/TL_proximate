'main_simulation' is the workflow for numerical simulations.
'main_empirical' is the workflow for empirical analyses (notice you need data to make it work).
'main_test_extended_dimension.R' is the workflow to test how the results change if we use different N and T.
'main_test_temporal_autocorrelation.R' is the workflow to test how the results change if we include the temporal autocorrelation.

The aphid and plankton data used for this study can be obtained after getting permission from the data owners, the Rothamsted Insect Survey and the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science, which is part of the Marine Biological Association of the UK. Chlorophyll data from the California current were processed from https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/index.html?page=1&itemsPerPage=1000.
