'main_simulation' is the workflow for numerical simulations.
'main_empirical' is the workflow for empirical analyses (notice you need data to make it work).
'main_test_extended_dimension.R' is the workflow to test how the results change if we use different N and T.
'main_test_temporal_autocorrelation.R' is the workflow to test how the results change if we include the temporal autocorrelation.
